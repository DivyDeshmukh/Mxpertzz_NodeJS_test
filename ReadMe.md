# Primarily, I am starting with the backend part because after creating the api and writing business logic, I can simply call that from the frontend and show the data on the UI.

# Project Setup in backend
1. Primarily, create files like.gitignore, .env (for secret variables), and other necessary files.
2. install essential packages like express, mongoose, dotenv, etc.
3. connect with DB and also add configurations like cors, etc.
4. write models
5. write controller and routes one by one

# After Setup in backend:-
1. Database is connected
2. Configurations set
3. Essential utilities setup
4. Models creation one by one.
5. Now, Creating Routes and Controllers simultaneously one by one.
    -- Primarily, the user controller I have created and also handled it through jwt.
    -- now, after this one by one I will create other controllers and routes
6.Finally, the csv feature I had developed.


# Project setup in Frontend and working
1. used vite as a module bundler bcoz it's faster.
2. then simply performed state management with redux.
3. Also, axios is used for making API requests to the server
4. Handled JWT tokens
