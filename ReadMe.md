# Primarily, I am starting with the backend part because after creating the api and writing business logic, I can simply call that from the frontend and show the data on the UI.

# Project Setup in backend

# After Setup in backend:-
1. Database is connected
2. Configurations set
3. Essential utilities setup
4. Models creation one by one.
5. Now, Creating Routes and Controllers simultaneously one by one.
    -- Primarily, the user controller I have created and also handled it through jwt.
    -- now, after this one by one I will create other controllers and routes
